* (2.1) Random walks in grade space

:END:
Many students complain about multiple-choice exams, saying that it is easy to get a bad grade just by being unlucky in what questions get asked. While easy and unambiguous to grade, are they good measures of knowledge and skill? A course is graded using multiple choice exams, with ten points for each problem. A particular student has a probability 0.7 of getting each question correct.

** Generalize the coin-flip random walk discussion to calculate the student’s mean score \(\langle S_N\rangle\), the mean square score \(\langle S_N^2\rangle\), and the standard deviation \(\sigma_N = \sqrt{\langle (S_N - \langle S_N\rangle)^2\rangle}\) for a test with \(N\) questions
Note that \(\langle s_{N-1}\ell_N\rangle \ne 0\).

Let \(s_j\) be the individual scores of each question (\(1\leq i\leq N\)) and \(S_N\) be the total score. Let the correct answer be graded with \(+g_1\) and a wrong answer be graded with \(-g_2\),

\begin{align*}
P_j(\mathrm{correct}) = 0.7, \quad s_j(\mathrm{correct}) = +g_1 \\
P_j(\mathrm{wrong}) = 0.3, \quad s_j(\mathrm{wrong}) = -g_2 \\
S_N = \sum_{j=1}^Ns_j
\end{align*}

The student's mean score, mean square score and standard deviation for each question,

\begin{align*}
\langle s_{j}\rangle &=P\left( \mathrm{correct}\right) s_{j}\left( \mathrm{correct} \right) +P\left( \mathrm{wrong}\right) s_{j}\left( \mathrm{wrong}\right) \\
&= (0.7)(+g_1)+(0.3)(-g_2) \\
&= 0.7g_1-0.3g_2 \\
\langle s_{j}^2\rangle &=P\left( \mathrm{correct}\right) (s_{j}\left( \mathrm{correct} \right))^2 +P\left( \mathrm{wrong}\right) (s_{j}\left( \mathrm{wrong}\right))^2 \\
&= (0.7)(+g_1)^2+(0.3)(-g_2)^2 \\
&= 0.7g_1^2+0.3g_2^2 \\
\sigma_j &= \sqrt{\langle s^2_j \rangle - \langle s_j\rangle^2} \\
&= \sqrt{0.21g_1^2+0.21g_2^2+0.42g_1g_2}\\
&\approx 0.458(g_1+g_2)
\end{align*}


The student's total mean score and mean square score,

\begin{align*}
\langle S_{N}\rangle &=  \langle \sum_{j=1}^Ns_j \rangle \\
&=  \langle s_j \rangle \sum_{j=1}^N 1 \\
&=  \langle s_j \rangle N \\
\langle S^2_{N}\rangle &=  \langle \sum_{j=1}^Ns^2_j \rangle \\
&=  \langle s^2_j \rangle \sum_{j=1}^N 1 \\
&=  \langle s^2_j \rangle N \\
\end{align*}

The standard deviation of the total score,

\begin{align*}
\sigma_N &= \sqrt{\langle (S_N - \langle S_N\rangle)^2\rangle} \\
&= \sqrt{\langle S^2_N \rangle - \langle S_N\rangle^2} \\
&= \sqrt{N\langle s^2_j \rangle - N\langle s_j\rangle^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\langle s^2_j \rangle - \langle s_j\rangle^2}\sqrt{N} \\
&= \sigma_j \sqrt{N}
\end{align*}

Measuring instruments in physics are often characterized by the signal-to-noise ratio. One can view the random choice of questions as a source of noise, and this calculation as an estimate of that noise.

** An introductory engineering physics exam with ten ten-point multiple choice questions has a class mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 15. How much of the standard deviation is attributable to random chance (noise), as we calculate in the previous? If the remainder of the variation between people is considered the signal, is it a good test, with a high signal to noise ratio?

Mean and standard deviation of the test,

\begin{align*}
\langle S\rangle = 70 \\
\sigma = 15
\end{align*}

Mean and standard deviation attributable to random chance (noise),

\begin{align*}
g_1 = 10, \quad g_2 =0, \quad N =10 \\
\langle s_j\rangle = 7 \\
\sigma_j = 4.58 \\
\langle S_r\rangle = \langle s_j\rangle N = 70 \\
\sigma_r = \sigma_j \sqrt{N} = 14.48\\
\end{align*}

Signal to noise ratio,

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{SNR} = \dfrac{\langle S\rangle}{\sigma_r} = 4.83
\end{align*}

It is better to have High SNR, as Low SNR indicates that the students depend on luck rather than their ability.

* (2.2) Photon diffusion in the Sun

:END:

If fusion in the Sun turned off today, how long would it take for us to notice? This question became urgent some time back when the search for solar neutrinos failed. Neutrinos, created in the same fusion reaction that creates heat in the Solar core, pass through the Sun at near the speed of light without scattering—giving us a current status report. The rest of the energy takes longer to get out.

Most of the fusion energy generated by the Sun is produced near its center. The Sun is \(7 \times 10^{5}\) km in radius. Convection probably dominates heat transport in approximately the outer third of the Sun, but it is believed that energy is transported through the inner portions (say from \(R= 0 \) to \(5\times 10^{5}\) km) through a random walk of X-ray photons.  (A photon is a quantized package of energy; you may view it as a particle which always moves at the speed of light \(c\). Ignore for this exercise the index of refraction of the Sun.) There are a range of estimates for the mean free path for a photon in the Sun. For our purposes, assume photons travel at the speed of light, but bounce in random directions (without pausing) with a step size of \(\ell=0.1\mathrm{cm}=10^{-3}\mathrm{m}\).

** About how many random steps \(N\) will the photon take of length \(\ell\) to get to the radius \(R\) where convection becomes important?

\begin{align*}
\langle R\rangle = \ell \sqrt{N} \\
N \approx (\dfrac{R}{\ell})^2 =  2.5 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{steps}
\end{align*}

**  About how many years \(T\) will it take for the photon to get there?

Scattering time,

\begin{align*}
\tau = \dfrac{\ell}{c} = 3.33 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{s}
\end{align*}

Time taken for photon to cross the inner region,

\begin{align*}
T = N\tau &= 8.33 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{s} \\
&= 27778 \mathrm{years}
\end{align*}

* (2.3) Molecular motors and random walks

Inside your cells, there are several different molecular motors, which move and pull and copy (Fig). There are molecular motors which contract your muscles, there are motors which copy (transcribe) your DNA into RNA and copy (translate) your RNA into protein, there are motors which transport biomolecules around in the cell. All of these motors share some common features:
1. They move along some linear track (microtubule, DNA, . . . ), hopping forward in discrete jumps between low-energy positions;
2. They consume energy (burning ATP or NTP) as they move, generating an effective force pushing them forward;
3. Their mechanical properties can be studied by seeing how their motion changes as the external force on them is changed.
For transcription of DNA into RNA, the motor moves on average one base pair (A, T, G, or C) per step; \(\Delta x\) is about 0.34nm. The motor must cross an asymmetric energy barrier as it attaches another nucleotide to the RNA (Fig). Wang and co-authors (Fig) showed that the motor stalls at an external force of about 27pN (pico-Newton).

** At that force, what is the energy difference between neighboring wells due to the external force from the bead? Let us assume that this stall force is what is needed to balance the natural force downhill that the motor develops to propel the transcription process. What does this imply about the ratio of the forward rate to the backward rate, in the absence of the external force from the laser tweezers, at a temperature of 300 K?

The population in a well of free energy \(G\) is proportional to \(\exp{(-G/k_BT)}\). If the population was in thermal equilibrium the net flux would be equal going forward and backward; the net flux out of a well is the population in that well times the rate, a given motor does not know whether it is part of an equilibrium ensemble.

The energy (or rather the Gibbs free energy) for the molecular motor as a function of distance along the DNA. The motor is in a low-energy state just after it transcribes one nucleotide into RNA. The energy barrier \(V\) needs to be crossed in order to transcribe the next nucleotide. The energy asymmetry \(\delta\) is a sum of contributions from the bonding of the RNA nucleotide, the burning of ATP, and the detachment of the apparatus at the completed end. The experiment changes this asymmetry by adding an external force tilting the potential to the left, retarding the transcription.

The natural force downhill is coming from the (Fig)chemical reactions which accompany the motor moving one base pair; the motor burns up an NTP molecule into a PPi molecule, and attaches a nucleotide onto the RNA. The net energy from this reaction depends on details, but varies between about 2 and 5 times 10−20 J. This is actually a Gibbs free energy difference, but for this exercise treat it as just an energy difference.

** The motor is not perfectly efficient; not all the chemical energy is available as motor force. From the answer above, give the efficiency of the motor as the ratio of force-times-distance produced to energy consumed, for the range of consumed energies given.

Many of the models for these motors are based on Feynman’s /Ratchet and pawl/ discussion  where he (presciently) speculates about how gears and ratchets would work on a molecular level.

The laser beam is focused at a point (the laser trap); the polystyrene bead is pulled (from dielectric effects) into the intense part of the light beam. The track is a DNA molecule attached to the bead, the motor is an RNA polymerase molecule, and the force is applied by a glass cover slip to which the motor is attached. As the motor copies DNA onto RNA, it pulls the DNA track toward itself, dragging the bead out of the trap, generating a force resisting the motion.
