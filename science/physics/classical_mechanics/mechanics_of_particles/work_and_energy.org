Consider the work done by the external force \(\vec{F}\) upon the particle in going
from point 1 to point 2. By definition, this work is

\begin{align*}
W_{12}=\int ^{2}_{1}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{s}
\end{align*}

For constant mass (as will be assumed from now on unless otherwise specified),
the integral becomes

\begin{align*}
\int \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{s}=m\int \dfrac{d\vec{v}}{dt}\cdot \vec{v}dt=\dfrac{m}{2}\int \dfrac{d}{dt}\left( v^{2}\right) dt\\
W_{12}=\dfrac{m}{2}\left( v_{2}^{2}-v_{1}^{2}\right)
\end{align*}

The scalar quantity \(\dfrac{mv^{2}}{2}\) is called the kinetic energy of the particle and is deÂ­
noted by \(T\), so that the work done is equal to the change in the kinetic energy:

\begin{align*}
W_{12}=T_{2}-T_{1}
\end{align*}

If the force field is such that the work \(W_{12}\) is the same for any physically
possible path between points 1 and 2, then the force (and the system) is said to be
/conservative/. An alternative description of a conservative system is obtained by
imagining the particle being taken from point 1 to point 2 by one possible path
and then being returned to point 1 by another path. The independence of \(W_{12}\) on
the particular path implies that the work done around such a closed circuit is zero,
i.e.:

\begin{align*}
\oint \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{s}=0
\end{align*}
